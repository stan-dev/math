This class has the following responsibilities:

* Maintaining a list of main targets in this project and building them.

--
1. [[bbv2.reference.class.project-target.generate]] `rule generate ( property-set )`
+
Overrides
link:#bbv2.reference.class.abstract-target.generate[abstract-target.generate].
Generates virtual targets for all the targets contained in this project.
+
On success, returns:
+
* a property-set with the usage requirements to be applied to dependents
* a list of produced virtual targets, which may be empty.

2. `rule build-dir ( )`
+
Returns the root build directory of the project.

3. `rule main-target ( name )`
+
Returns a link:#bbv2.reference.class.main-target[main-target] class
instance corresponding to `name`. Can only be called after the project
has been fully loaded.

4. `rule has-main-target ( name )`
+
Returns whether a link:#bbv2.reference.class.main-target[main-target]
with the specified name exists. Can only be called after the project has
been fully loaded.

5. `rule find ( id : no-error ? )`
+
Find and return the target with the specified id, treated relative to
self. Id may specify either a target or a file name with the target
taking priority. May report an error or return nothing if the target is
not found depending on the `no-error` parameter.
