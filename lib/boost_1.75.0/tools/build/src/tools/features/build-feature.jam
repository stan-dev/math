[[bbv2.builtin.features.build]]`build`::
*Allowed values:* `no`
+
Used to conditionally disable build of a target. If `<build>no` is in
properties when building a target, build of that target is skipped. Combined
with conditional requirements this allows you to skip building some target in
configurations where the build is known to fail.
