[[bbv2.builtin.features.cflags]]`cflags`; `cxxflags`; `linkflags`::
The value of these features is passed without modification to the corresponding
tools. For `cflags` that is both the C and {CPP} compilers, for `cxxflags` that
is the {CPP} compiler, and for `linkflags` that is the linker. The features are
handy when you are trying to do something special that cannot be achieved by a
higher-level feature in B2.
