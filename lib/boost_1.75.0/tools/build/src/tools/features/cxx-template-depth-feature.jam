[[bbv2.builtin.features.cpp-template-depth]]`c++-template-depth`::
*Allowed values:* Any positive integer.
+
Allows configuring a {CPP} compiler with the maximal template instantiation
depth parameter. Specific toolsets may or may not provide support for this
feature depending on whether their compilers provide a corresponding
command-line option.
+
NOTE: Due to some internal details in the current B2 implementation it
is not possible to have features whose valid values are all positive integer.
As a workaround a large set of allowed values has been defined for this feature
and, if a different one is needed, user can easily add it by calling the
feature.extend rule.

# TODO: This should be upgraded as soon as Boost Build adds support for custom
# validated feature values or at least features allowing any positive integral
# value. See related Boost Build related trac ticket #194.
