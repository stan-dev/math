[[bbv2.builtin.features.cxxstd]]`cxxstd`::
*Allowed values*: `98`, `03`, `0x`, `11`, `1y`, `14`, `1z`, `17`, `2a`, `20`,
`latest`.
+
Specifies the version of the C++ Standard Language to build with. All the
official versions of the standard since "98" are included.  It is also possible
to specify using the experimental, work in progress, `latest` version. Some
compilers specified intermediate versions for the experimental versions leading
up to the released standard version. Those are included following the GNU
nomenclature as `0x`, `1y`, `1z`, and `2a`. Depending on the compiler `latest`
would map to one of those.

NOTE: This is an `optional` feature. Hence when not specified the compiler
default behaviour is used.

NOTE: Please consult the toolset specific documentation for which `cxxstd`
is supported.

[[bbv2.builtin.features.cxxstd-dialect]]`cxxstd-dialect`::
*Subfeature of* `cxxstd`
+
*Allowed values*: `iso`, `gnu`, `ms`.
+
Indicates if a non-standard dialect should be used. These usually have
either/or extensions or platform specific functionality. Not specifying the
dialect will default to 'iso' which will attempt to use ISO C++ Standard
conformance to the best of the compiler's ability.
