[[bbv2.builtin.features.runtime-debugging]]`runtime-debugging`::
*Allowed values:* `on`, `off`.
+
Specifies whether produced object files, executables, and libraries should
include behavior useful only for debugging, such as asserts. Typically, the
value of this feature is implicitly set by the `variant` feature, but it can be
explicitly specified by the user. The most common usage is to build release
variant with debugging output.

[[bbv2.builtin.features.runtime-link]]`runtime-link`::
*Allowed values:* `shared`, `static`
+
Controls if a static or shared C/{CPP} runtime should be used. There are some
restrictions how this feature can be used, for example on some compilers an
application using static runtime should not use shared libraries at all, and on
some compilers, mixing static and shared runtime requires extreme care. Check
your compiler documentation for more details.
