= The Data Structure

The containers are made up of a number of 'buckets', each of which can contain
any number of elements. For example, the following diagram shows an <<unordered_set,unordered_set>> with 7 buckets containing 5 elements, `A`,
`B`, `C`, `D` and `E` (this is just for illustration, containers will typically
have more buckets).

In order to decide which bucket to place an element in, the container applies
the hash function, `Hash`, to the element's key (for `unordered_set` and
`unordered_multiset` the key is the whole element, but is referred to as the key
so that the same terminology can be used for sets and maps). This returns a
value of type `std::size_t`. `std::size_t` has a much greater range of values
then the number of buckets, so the container applies another transformation to
that value to choose a bucket to place the element in.

Retrieving the elements for a given key is simple. The same process is applied
to the key to find the correct bucket. Then the key is compared with the
elements in the bucket to find any elements that match (using the equality
predicate `Pred`). If the hash function has worked well the elements will be
evenly distributed amongst the buckets so only a small number of elements will
need to be examined.

There is <<hash_equality, more information on hash functions and
equality predicates in the next section>>.

You can see in the diagram that `A` & `D` have been placed in the same bucket.
When looking for elements in this bucket up to 2 comparisons are made, making
the search slower. This is known as a collision. To keep things fast we try to
keep collisions to a minimum.

== Controlling the number of buckets

As more elements are added to an unordered associative container, the number
of elements in the buckets will increase causing performance to degrade.
To combat this the containers increase the bucket count as elements are inserted.
You can also tell the container to change the bucket count (if required) by
calling `rehash`.

The standard leaves a lot of freedom to the implementer to decide how the
number of buckets is chosen, but it does make some requirements based on the
container's 'load factor', the average number of elements per bucket.
Containers also have a 'maximum load factor' which they should try to keep the
load factor below.

You can't control the bucket count directly but there are two ways to
influence it:

* Specify the minimum number of buckets when constructing a container or when calling `rehash`.
* Suggest a maximum load factor by calling `max_load_factor`.

`max_load_factor` doesn't let you set the maximum load factor yourself, it just
lets you give a _hint_. And even then, the standard doesn't actually
require the container to pay much attention to this value. The only time the
load factor is _required_ to be less than the maximum is following a call to
`rehash`. But most implementations will try to keep the number of elements
below the max load factor, and set the maximum load factor to be the same as
or close to the hint - unless your hint is unreasonably small or large.

|Method |Description

|`X(size_type n)` 
|Construct an empty container with at least `n` buckets (`X` is the container type).

|`X(InputIterator i, InputIterator j, size_type n)` 
|Construct an empty container with at least `n` buckets and insert elements from the range `[i, j)` (`X` is the container type).

|`float load_factor() const` 
|The average number of elements per bucket.

|`float max_load_factor() const`
|Returns the current maximum load factor.

|`float max_load_factor(float z)`
|Changes the container's maximum load factor, using `z` as a hint.

|`void rehash(size_type n)`
|Changes the number of buckets so that there at least `n` buckets, and so that the load factor is less than the maximum load factor.

== Iterator Invalidation

It is not specified how member functions other than `rehash` and `reserve` affect
the bucket count, although `insert` is only allowed to invalidate iterators
when the insertion causes the load factor to be greater than or equal to the
maximum load factor. For most implementations this means that `insert` will only
change the number of buckets when this happens. While iterators can be
invalidated by calls to `insert`, `rehash` and `reserve`, pointers and references to the
container's elements are never invalidated.

In a similar manner to using `reserve` for ``vector``s, it can be a good idea
to call `reserve` before inserting a large number of elements. This will get
the expensive rehashing out of the way and let you store iterators, safe in
the knowledge that they won't be invalidated. If you are inserting `n`
elements into container `x`, you could first call:

```
x.reserve(n);
```

Note:: `reserve(n)` reserves space for at least `n` elements, allocating enough buckets
so as to not exceed the maximum load factor.
+
Because the maximum load factor is defined as the number of elements divided by the total
number of available buckets, this function is logically equivalent to:
+
```
x.rehash(std::ceil(n / x.max_load_factor()))
```
+
See the <<unordered_map_rehash,reference for more details>> on the `rehash` function.
