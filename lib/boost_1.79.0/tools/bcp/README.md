BCP Tool [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/boostorg/bcp.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/boostorg/bcp)
==================

The bcp utility is a tool for extracting subsets of Boost, it's useful for Boost authors who want to distribute 
their library separately from Boost, and for Boost users who want to distribute a subset of Boost with their application.

bcp can also report on which parts of Boost your code is dependent on, and what licences are used by those dependencies.

The full documentation is available on [boost.org](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/tools/bcp).
