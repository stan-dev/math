[section Non-throwing conversions]

For the case where throwing exceptions is undesirable, Boost.JSON also provides
a non-throwing version of __value_to__, the function template
__try_value_to__.  It returns __result__, a specialised variant that either
holds a value or an __error_code__.

[note There's no non-throwing equivalent for __value_from__. This is simply
because we haven't yet encountered a situation where __value_from__ needed to
communicate an error to the caller.]

The library provides non-throwing conversions for all the categories of types
it supports with __value_to__. If a user wants to use it with custom types,
an overload of `tag_invoke` of this form needs to be provided:

```
result_for<T, value>::type
tag_invoke( const try_value_to_tag< T >&, const value& );
```

For the class `ip_address` from the section
[link json.conversion.custom_conversions Custom conversions] this overload may
look like this:

[snippet_nothrow_1]

The overload lets us use `ip_address` with __try_value_to__.

[snippet_nothrow_2]

If __try_value_to__ is used with a type, for which there's no `tag_invoke`
overload of the form described in this section, but there is one of the form
intended for __value_to__, then the library still tries to perform the
conversion. It uses the throwing overload, and attempts to convert any thrown
exception into an __error_code__. Note, though, that such approach will likely
be slower then a dedicated overload.

The opposite is also true: if there's a `tag_invoke` overload intended for
__try_value_to__, but not for __value_to__, then calling `__value_to__` will
invoke the non-throwing overload, then construct a __system_error__ from the
__error_code__ and throw it. Due to these fallbacks, it is recommended that
users provide the overload from this section, rather then the other one, if
they ever intend to use __try_value_to__.
