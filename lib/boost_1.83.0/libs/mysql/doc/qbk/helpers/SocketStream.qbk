[section:boost__mysql__SocketStream SocketStream concept]

`SocketStream` should meet the [reflink Stream] requirements.
Additionally, it should have a `lowest_layer_type` member type,
and a `lowest_layer` member function, returning a `lowest_layer_type&`,
following Asio's layered stream model. Additionally,
`lowest_layer_type` should inherit from an instantiation of 
[asioreflink basic_stream_socket basic_stream_socket].

The types `boost::asio::basic_stream_socket<Protocol, Executor>` and
`boost::asio::ssl::stream<boost::asio::basic_stream_socket<Protocol, Executor>>`
meet these requirements.
