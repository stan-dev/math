# Revision History
:idprefix:

## Changes in Boost 1.84.0

* Added an overload of `enum_from_string` that takes a string view, to avoid
  the need for null termination.

## Changes in Boost 1.81.0

* To allow the inclusion of `enumerators.hpp`, `bases.hpp`, and `members.hpp`
  when the option `-pedantic` is used, the invocation of `BOOST_DESCRIBE_ENUM`
  has been moved from `modifiers.hpp` into a separate header,
  `modifier_description.hpp`. As a consequence, `modifiers.hpp` no longer
  includes `enum.hpp`. Code that has been relying on this implicit inclusion
  may fail, and will need to be fixed to include `enum.hpp`.

## Changes in Boost 1.79.0

* Enabled unions in `BOOST_DESCRIBE_STRUCT` and updated examples to check `std::is_union<T>`.
* Added example of defining a `fmtlib` class formatter.
* Added example of defining a `fmtlib` enum formatter.
* Added example of printing pointers to members.

## Changes in Boost 1.78.0

* Added `has_describe_enumerators`, `has_describe_bases`, `has_describe_members`.
* Added `enum_to_string`, `enum_from_string`.
* Added relational and stream insertion operators.
* Added `descriptor_by_name`, `descriptor_by_pointer`.
* Added `struct_to_tuple` example.
