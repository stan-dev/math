[[bbv2.builtin.features.response-file]]`response-file`::
*Allowed values:* `auto`, `file`, `contents`.
+
Controls whether a response file is used, or not, during the build of the
applicable target. For `file` a response file is created and the filename
replaced in the action. For `contents` the contents (`:E=`) is replaced
in the action and no response file is created. For `auto` either a response
file is created, or the contents replaced, based on the length of the
contents such that if the contents fits within the limits of the command
execution line length limits the contents is replaced. Otherwise a
response file is created and the filename is replaced in the actions.
+
Supported for `clang-linux` and `msvc` toolsets.
