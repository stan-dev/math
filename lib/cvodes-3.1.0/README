The family of solvers referred to as SUNDIALS consists of the following solvers:
 ARKODE - for integration of ordinary differential equation systems (ODEs)
          ARKODE treats stiff, nonstiff and multi-rate ODE systems of the form
          y' = fe(t,y) + fi(t,y), y(t0) = y0
 CVODE  - for integration of ordinary differential equation systems (ODEs)
          CVODE treats stiff and nonstiff ODE systems of the form
          y' = f(t,y), y(t0) = y0
 CVODES - for integration and sensitivity analysis of ODEs
          CVODES treats stiff and nonstiff ODE systems of the form
          y' = f(t,y,p), y(t0) = y0(p)
 IDA    - for integration of differential-algebraic equation systems (DAEs)
          IDA treats DAE systems of the form
          F(t,y,y') = 0, y(t0) = y0, y'(t0) = y0'
 IDAS   - for integration and sensitivity analysis of DAEs
          IDAS treats DAE systems of the form
          F(t,y,y',p) = 0, y(t0) = y0(p), y'(t0) = y0'(p)
 KINSOL - for solution of nonlinear algebraic systems
          KINSOL treats nonlinear systems of the form
          F(u) = 0

The various solvers of this family share many subordinate modules.
For this reason, it is organized as a family, with a directory structure 
that exploits that sharing. Each individual solver includes documentation 
on installation, along with full usage documentation.

Warning to users who receive more than one of these individual solvers
at different times: The mixing of old and new versions of SUNDIALS may fail.  
To avoid such failures, obtain all desired solvers at the same time.

For installation directions see the file INSTALL_GUIDE.pdf.
