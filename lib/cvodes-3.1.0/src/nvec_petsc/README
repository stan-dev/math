NVECTOR_PETSC is an NVECTOR wrapper around the PETSC vector.  

NVECTOR_PETSC defines the content field of an N_Vector to be a 
structure containing the global and local lengths of the vector, a 
pointer to the PETSC vector, an MPI communicator, and a boolean 
flag indicating ownership of the wrapped PETSC vector.

NVECTOR_PETSC defines implementations of all vector operations defined
by the generic NVECTOR module in the table of operations, except for 
N_VSetArrayPointer and N_VGetArrayPointer, because accessing raw vector
data should be handled by PETSC functions.  As such, this vector is not 
available for use with SUNDIALS Fortran interfaces. When access to raw 
vector data is needed, one should extract the PETSC vector first, and 
then use PETSC methods to access the data. Usage examples of NVECTOR_PETSC
are provided in example programs for IDA.
