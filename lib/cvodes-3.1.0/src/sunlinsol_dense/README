                     SUNLINSOL_DENSE
                 released as part of SUNDIALS
    SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers
                   Release 3.0.0, September 2017


Dense implementation of the SUNLINSOL module for SUNDIALS. 

SUNLINSOL_DENSE defines the content field of SUNMatrix to be a structure 
containing a pivot array for performing LU factorization with row
pivoting, along with a long integer for any error flag that arises in
the factorization process.

SUNLINSOL_DENSE defines macros to provide access to the content of 
a dense SUNLinearSolver, and constructor for the dense
SUNLinearSolver, in addition to implementation of all linear
solver operations defined by the generic SUNLINSOL module in the table
of operations.


A. Documentation
----------------

The dense SUNLINSOL implementation is fully described in the user
documentation for any of the SUNDIALS solvers. A PDF file for the user
guide for a particular solver is available in the solver's
subdirectory under doc/. 


B. Installation
