                 released as part of SUNDIALS
    SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers
                   Release 3.0.0, September 2017


LAPACK dense implementation of the SUNLINSOL module for SUNDIALS. 

SUNLINSOL_LAPACKDENSE defines the content field of SUNMatrix to be a structure 
containing an integer 'pivots' array, along with a long integer for
any error flag that arises in the factorization process.

SUNLINSOL_LAPACKDENSE implements all linear solver operations defined
by the generic SUNLINSOL module in the table of operations.
