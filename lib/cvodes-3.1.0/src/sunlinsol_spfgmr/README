                     SUNLINSOL_SPFGMR
                 released as part of SUNDIALS
    SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers
                   Release 3.0.0, September 2017


Scaled, preconditioned, FGMRES implementation of the SUNLINSOL module
for SUNDIALS.  

SUNLINSOL_SPFGMR defines the content field of SUNMatrix to be a structure 
containing a X, along with a long integer for any error flag that arises in
the linear solver routines.

SUNLINSOL_SPFGMR defines N macros to provide access to the content of 
a SPFGMR SUNLinearSolver, and constructor for the SPFGMR
SUNLinearSolver, in addition to implementation of all linear
solver operations defined by the generic SUNLINSOL module in the table
of operations.
