                   Release 3.0.0, September 2017


Band implementation of the SUNMATRIX module for SUNDIALS. 

SUNMATRIX_BAND defines the content field of SUNMatrix to be a structure 
containing the number of rows and columns of the matrix, the total
allocated size of the matrix, the lower and upper bandwidth of the
matrix, the number of stored upper bands of the matrix (may be larger
than the actual matrix bandwidth to allow fill-in during LU
factorization), a pointer to the beginning of a contiguous data array,
the leading dimension of the data array (if contained inside a larger
data array), and an array of pointers to the first entry of each
column of the matrix. 

SUNMATRIX_BAND defines six macros to provide access to the content of 
a band SUNMatrix, a constructor for variables of type SUNMatrix,
destructors for SUNMatrix, and a utility function for printing a
banded SUNMatrix to screen/file.

SUNMATRIX_BAND provides implementations for all matrix operations defined
by the generic SUNMATRIX module in the table of operations.


A. Documentation
----------------

The band SUNMATRIX implementation is fully described in the user

guide for a particular solver is available in the solver's
subdirectory under doc/.
