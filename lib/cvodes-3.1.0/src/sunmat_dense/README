                 released as part of SUNDIALS
    SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers
                   Release 3.0.0, September 2017


Dense implementation of the SUNMATRIX module for SUNDIALS. 

SUNMATRIX_DENSE defines the content field of SUNMatrix to be a structure 
containing the number of rows and columns of the matrix, the total
allocated size of the matrix, a pointer to the beginning of a
contiguous data array, and an array of pointers to the first entry of
each column of the matrix.

SUNMATRIX_DENSE defines six macros to provide access to the content of 
a dense SUNMatrix, a constructor for variables of type SUNMatrix,
destructors for SUNMatrix, and a utility function for printing a
dense SUNMatrix to screen/file.

SUNMATRIX_DENSE provides implementations for all matrix operations defined
by the generic SUNMATRIX module in the table of operations.
