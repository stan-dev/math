                   Release 3.0.0, September 2017


Sparse implementation of the SUNMATRIX module for SUNDIALS. 

SUNMATRIX_SPARSE defines the content field of SUNMatrix to be a structure 
containing the type of sparse matrix (CSC_MAT vs CSR_MAT), the number
of rows and columns of the matrix, the number of nonzeros in the
matrix, a pointer to the beginning of a contiguous data array for the
matrix values, a pointer to the beginning of a contiguous index array
for the row/column indices of those values, a pointer to the beginning
of a contiguous data array for the starting indices of each column/row 
in the value/index arrays, and auxiliary pointers to simplify
routines for handling CSC and CSR interfaces.

SUNMATRIX_SPARSE defines nine macros to provide access to the content of 
a sparse SUNMatrix, constructors for objects of type SUNMatrix,
destructors for SUNMatrix, and a utility function for printing a
sparse SUNMatrix to screen/file.

SUNMATRIX_SPARSE provides implementations for all matrix operations defined
by the generic SUNMATRIX module in the table of operations.


A. Documentation
----------------

The sparse SUNMATRIX implementation is fully described in the user

guide for a particular solver is available in the solver's
subdirectory under doc/.
