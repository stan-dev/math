                     NVECTOR_SERIAL
                 released as part of SUNDIALS
    SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers
                   Release 2.7.0, September 2016


Serial implementation of the NVECTOR module for SUNDIALS. 

NVECTOR_SERIAL defines the content field of N_Vector to be a structure 
containing the length of the vector, a pointer to the beginning of a 
contiguous data array, and a boolean flag indicating ownership of the 
data array.

NVECTOR_SERIAL defines five macros to provide access to the content of 
a serial N_Vector, several constructors for variables of type N_Vector,
a constructor for an array of variables of type N_Vector, and destructors
for N_Vector and N_Vector array.

NVECTOR_SERIAL provides implementations for all vector operations defined
by the generic NVECTOR module in the table of operations.


A. Documentation
----------------

The serial NVECTOR implementation is fully described in the user documentation 
for any of the SUNDIALS solvers [1-5]. A PDF file for the user guide for a
particular solver is available in the solver's subdirectory under doc/.


B. Installation
---------------

For basic installation instructions see /sundials/INSTALL_GUIDE.pdf. 
For complete installation instructions see any of the user guides.
