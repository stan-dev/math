### Version 5.2.0 (Mar 2020)

CVODES is a package for the solution of stiff and nonstiff ordinary differential
equation (ODE) systems (initial value problem) given in explicit form
```
dy/dt = f(t,y,p), y(t0) = y0(p)
```
with sensitivity analysis capabilities (both forward and adjoint modes). CVODES
provides a choice of two variable-order, variable-coefficient multistep methods,
Adams-Moulton methods for non-stiff problems or BDF (Backward Differentiation
Formula) methods in fixed-leading-coefficient form for stiff problems.

CVODES is part of the SUNDIALS Suite of Nonlinear and Differential/Algebraic
equation Solvers which consists of ARKode, CVODE, CVODES, IDA, IDAS and KINSOL.
It is written in ANSI standard C and can be used in a variety of computing
environments including serial, shared memory, distributed memory, and
accelerator-based (e.g., GPU) systems. This flexibility is obtained from a
modular design that leverages the shared vector, matrix, linear solver, and
nonlinear solver APIs used across SUNDIALS packages.
