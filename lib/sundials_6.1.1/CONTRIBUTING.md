# Contributing to SUNDIALS

At this time, the SUNDIALS team does not have the resources to review and take
in large additions to the code or significant new features. Contributions
addressing bug fixes or minor changes are preferred via a pull request to the
[SUNDIALS GitHub repository](https://github.com/LLNL/sundials).

All new contributions to SUNDIALS must be made under the BSD 3-clause license.

SUNDIALS team will not accept any file previously released under any other open
source license. By submitting code, the contributor gives irreversible consent
to the redistribution and/or modification of the contributed source code.

Please ensure that any pull request includes user guide additions or changes as
appropriate, has been tested, and includes a test for any added features.

Any added files submitted with a pull request must contain a header section at
the top including the originating author's name and file origin date as well as

As discussed in the [Docker software project blog](https://blog.docker.com/2014/01/docker-code-contributions-require-developer-certificate-of-origin/)
this DCO "lets us know that you are entitled to contribute this code to

derivative works."

"By including the DCO signature, you are stating that one or
more of the following is true of your contribution:

1.  You created this contribution/change and have the right to submit it
    to SUNDIALS; or
2.  You created this contribution/change based on a previous work with a
    compatible open source license; or
3.  This contribution/change has been provided to you by someone who did
    1 or 2 and you are submitting the contribution unchanged.
4.  You understand this contribution is public and may be redistributed as
    open source software" under the BSD license.

All commits submitted to the SUNDIALS project need to have the following sign
off line in the commit message:
```
Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jdoe@address.com>
```
Replacing Jane Doeâ€™s details with your name and email address.

If you've set `user.name` and `user.email` in your Git configuration, you can
automatically add a sign off line at the end of the commit message by using the
`-s` option (e.g., `git commit -s`).
