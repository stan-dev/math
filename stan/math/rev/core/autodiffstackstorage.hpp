/**
 * This struct always provides access to the autodiff stack using
 * the singleton pattern. Read warnings below!
 *
 * The singleton <code>instance_</code> is a global static pointer,
 * which is thread local (TLS) if the STAN_THREADS preprocess variable
 * is defined.
 *
 * The use of a pointer is motivated by performance reasons for the
 * threading case. When a TLS is used, initialization with a constant
 * expression at compile time is required for fast access to the
 * TLS. As the autodiff storage struct is non-POD, its initialization
 * is a dynamic expression at compile time. These dynamic expressions
 * are wrapped, in the TLS case, by a TLS wrapper function which slows
 * down its access. Using a pointer instead allows to initialize at
 * compile time to <code>nullptr</code>, which is a compile time
 * constant. In this case, the compiler avoids the use of a TLS
 * wrapper function.
 *
 * For performance reasons we use the __thread keyword on compilers
 * which support it. The __thread keyword is a GNU compiler-specific
 * (gcc, clang, Intel) extension which requires initialization with a
 * compile time constant expression. The C++11 keyword thread_local
 * does allow for constant and dynamic initialization of the
 * TLS. Thus, only the __thread keyword gurantees that constant
 * initialization and it's implied speedup, is used.
 *
 * The initialzation of the AD instance at run-time is handled by the
 * lifetime of a AutodiffStackSingleton object. More specifically, the
 * first instance of the AutodiffStackSingleton object will initialize
 * the AD instance and take ownership (it is the only one instance
 * with the private member own_instance_ being true). Thus, whenever
 * the first instance of the AutodiffStackSingleton object gets
 * destructed, the AD tape will be destructed as well. Within
 * stan-math the initialization of the AD instance for the main thread
 * of the program is handled by instantiating the singleton once in
 * the init_chainablestack.hpp file. Whenever STAN_THREADS is defined
 * then all created child threads must instantiate a
 * AutodiffStackSingleton object within the child thread before
 * accessing the AD system in order to initialize the TLS AD tape
 * within the child thread.
 *
 * The design of a globally held (optionally TLS) pointer, which is
 * globally initialized, allows the compiler to apply necessary
 * inlining to get maximal performance. However, the design suffers
 * from "the static init order fiasco"[0]. Whenever the static init
 * order fiasco occurs, the C++ client of the library may instantiate
 * an AutodiffStackSingleton object at the adequate code position prior
 * to any AD tape access to ensure proper initialization order. In
 * exchange, we get a more performant singleton pattern with automatic
 * initialization of the AD stack for the main thread. There has been
 * some discussion on earlier designs using the Meyer singleton
 * approach; see [1] and [2] and the discussions those PRs link to as
 * well.
